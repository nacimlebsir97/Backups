# Intro
Data backups are the practice of creating copies of important data and storing them in a separate location to protect against loss caused by hardware failure, accidental deletion, cyberattacks, or natural disasters. They are critical because data is a vital asset for individuals and organizations alike, and losing it can disrupt operations, cause financial damage, and harm reputation. Backups ensure that data can be restored quickly and reliably, supporting business continuity and disaster recovery efforts.
